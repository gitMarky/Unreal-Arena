Submodules:
This repository contains two submodules:
- Library_ArenaGames (https://github.com/gitMarky/Library_ArenaGames)
- Library_Shooter (https://github.com/gitMarky/Library_Shooter)
- Library_Character (https://github.com/gitMarky/Library_Character)

These are separate projects, but the Hazard project references them, as may other projects.
If you already cloned these projects you do not have to synchronize the submodules here anymore.

You can use the scripts to create symbolic links to include in your OpenClonk folder:
- create_links.bat (for the normal project files), create_links_submodules.bat (if you use the submodules)
  You will need to run the console in administrator mode on windows for these scripts to work.
- create_links.sh (for the normal project files), create_links_submodules.sh (if you use the submodules)

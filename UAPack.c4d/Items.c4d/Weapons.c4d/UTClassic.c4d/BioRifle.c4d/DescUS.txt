Classification: Toxic Rifle

Primary Fire: Wads of Tarydium byproduct are lobbed at a medium rate of fire.

Secondary Fire: When trigger is held down, the BioRifle will create a much larger wad of byproduct. When this wad is launched, it will burst into smaller wads which will adhere to any surfaces.

Techniques: Byproducts will adhere to walls, floors, or ceilings. Chain reactions can be caused by covering entryways with this lethal green waste.

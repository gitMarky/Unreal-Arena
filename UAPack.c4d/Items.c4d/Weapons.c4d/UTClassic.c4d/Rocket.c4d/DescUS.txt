Classification: Heavy Ballistic

Primary Fire: Slow moving but deadly rockets are fired at opponents. Trigger can be held down to load up to six rockets at a time, which can be fired at once.

Secondary Fire: Grenades are lobbed from the barrel. Secondary trigger can be held as well to load up to six grenades.

Techniques: Because the Rocket Launcher can load up multiple rockets, it fires when you press the fire button again.
